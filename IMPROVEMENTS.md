# Improvement 1
To make it easier for users to search through the emails, I would add the ability to filter the given results. This would involve having, perhaps, a 'Filter' dropdown menu that allows the user to filter the results by recipient, sender, subject, etc. The description of this solution describes being able to retrieve and verify the emails of any concerning parties, but, without the ability to filter by email, this would be a long and tedious task.

# Improvement 2
It may be beneficial for users to be able to see the attachments to any emails. This could be accomplished by hovering over the paperclip/attachment symbol to display a popup that shows attachment names, file sizes, and file formats.
Similarly, being able to hover over the "extra recipient" badge and see the list of email addresses could also be beneficial to users of this software.


# Improvement 3
Similarly to my point above, being able to hover over the "extra recipient" badge and see the list of email addresses could also be beneficial to users of this software.

# Improvement 4
My UI mockup only factors for two scenarioes: less than 550 pixels wide, and 550 or more pixels wide. In order to be a more responsive app, additional scenarios should be considered. For example, a tablet may have trouble displaying the desktop layout as it is too small, but is too wide to display the mobile layout nicely.

# Improvement 6
With longer email addresses, the columns can be too thin to display said addresses in full. This is very inconvenient. To fix this, I would add the ability to click and drag to make columns thicker or thinner, or even the ability to change the font size so more text can be displayed in the tables at once.
